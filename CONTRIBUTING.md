## Code of Conduct

By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kirtanp98/mangaupdates-graphql-api/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests. Some guidlines:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- Be patient with approvals and responses, as there is only [kirtanp98 (me)](https://github.com/kirtanp98) working/maintaining this api.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the api, request a new feature, or talk about potential changes before a PR is created.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your information to the existing issue. Adding a reaction to the issue will let us know if others are facing it too.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our api are always welcome. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question.
- Add unit or e2e tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Code should be readable and easy to follow.
- Include documentation in the repo.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template.

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes, open an Issue to discuss these changes first.
